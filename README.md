# RobotRepository
Welcome to the official repository for **BlockPrint3D's Robot Development Projects**! This repository houses code and documentation related to the development of advanced robotic systems utilizing 3D printing and innovative technology.

---

## Overview
The repository contains scripts and resources for:
- Balancing robots using servos and MPU6050 sensors.
- Real-time adjustments based on sensor data for maintaining stability.
- Integration of I2C devices and dynamic servo control.

This repository is designed to facilitate learning, experimentation, and collaboration on robotic projects built using 3D-printed components.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Balancing**: Real-time calculations using MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- **Servo Control**: Smooth control of multiple servos using the `pigpio` library.
- **3D-Printed Components**: Code and designs optimized for 3D-printed robotic systems.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust servo positions and balancing parameters for different robot designs.

---

## Requirements
### Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi**: Used for running the code and interfacing with hardware.
- **MPU6050 Sensor**: Provides accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- **Servos**: Control the robot's joints.
- **3D-Printed Robot Frame**: Designed for this project.

### Software
- **Python 3**
- Required Python Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pigpio smbus
  ```
- **pigpio Daemon**: Ensure the `pigpio` daemon is running:
  ```bash
  sudo pigpiod
  ```
- Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi:
  ```bash
  sudo raspi-config
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlockPrint3D/RobotRepository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd RobotRepository
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Ensure the `pigpio` daemon is running before executing the scripts.

## Usage
### Running the Balancing Robot Program
1. Connect the MPU6050 sensor and servos to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Start the program:
   ```bash
   python3 BalancingRobot.py
   ```
3. Observe the robot maintain its balance dynamically in real time.
